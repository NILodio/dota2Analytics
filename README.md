==============================

## ðŸš¨ Warning: This project is currently undergoing restructuring. ðŸ˜Ž 

Please avoid using it at the moment and patiently await further updates.

Anticipated completion in the next couple of months. ðŸ˜Ž ðŸš€


--------


### Setup

1. First, yo need to create a virtual environment by running `make create_environment` on the root directory of this project please make sure you have `make` installed on your machine before running this command
2. Then, you need to install the dependecies by running `make requirements` on the same directory where `requirements.txt` located
3. Create `.env` file at the root directory of this project/repo or copy the `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`
4. Dota Key is required to run this project. You can get the key by registering at [OpenDota](https://www.opendota.com/) and get the key from the profile page.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Crucial please add the make coomand when you create a new command. It will help you to understand the command that you want to run. For example, if you want to get data process you can run `make data`



### How to Use this Tool After Doing Setup?
all this project is create with Makefile. Thus, you can run the command by using `make` command. Here are the list of command that you can use:


1. `make data` : This command will run the scrapping process. It will scrap the job data from JobStreet website and store the result to CSV

2. `make requirements` : This command will install all the dependencies that listed at `requirements.txt`

3. `make create_environment` : This command will create a virtual environment for this project

4. `make clean` : This command will remove the virtual environment and all the dependencies that installed on the virtual environment
